// To implement back arrow button do the following:

// Consider you have MainActivity which is your main activity and SecondActivity which is the second activity you are going to implement
// back arrow button. As you press back arrow button, your SecondActivity must be finished and open the MainActivity.

  getSupportActionBar().setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true);
  
2) In Manifest file, set MainActivity as the parent activity in your SecondActivity like this:
  <activity android:name=".SecondActivity" android:parentActivityName=".MainActivity"/>
